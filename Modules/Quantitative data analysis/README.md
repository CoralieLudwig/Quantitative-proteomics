This folder contains the modules dedicated to the quantitative data analysis. They all take as input the standardized format (see "Parsers" folder).
<br/>
<br/>

- ***QC :***<br/>

This module generates a report of quality and reproducibility of data in quantification matrix.

- ***DA :***<br/>

This module, after filtering proteins, normalizing intensities and imputing missing values, executes a differential analysis on quantification matrix. The worklow can be configured thanks to the following parameters :

| Parameter | Function | Values |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Normalisation | Should intensities be normalized or not ? | T / F |
| Filter.threshold.ms | Minimum number of file identified by MS/MS to keep the protein for the analysis | ℕ |
| Filter.threshold.obs | Minimum percentage of observed intensities in one condition at least to keep the protein for the analysis | {0,100} |
| Imputation.MNAR.model | Which model should be used to impute MNAR ? | percentile / gaussian |
| Imputation.MNAR.percentile | Which percentile should be used for the "percentile" imputation model ? | {0,1} |
| Imputation.MCAR.model | Which model should be used to impute MCAR ? | none / MNAR / knn |
| Imputation.MCAR.threshold.obs | Minimum number of observed intensities in a condition to classify the missing values as MCAR | {0, number of replicates} |
| Imputation.MCAR.threshold.MSMS | Minimum number of file identified by MS/MS in a condition to classify the missing values as MCAR | {0, number of replicates} |
| Imputation.knn.min.occurrences |  Minimum number of observed intensities in a condition to use the protein as a k-nearest-neighnour for KNN imputation model | {0, number of replicates} |
| Test.type | Which statistical test should be used ? | t.test / limma / wilcoxon |
| Test.log | Should intensities be transformed by log10 before executing the statistical test ? | T / F |
| Test.alternative | Choose if the statistical test should be unilateral or bilateral | two.sided / unilateral |
| Test.paired | Choose if the statistical test should be paired or not | T / F |
| Test.var.equal | If t.test is selected, precise if variance are equal (so a Student t.test will be used) or not (so a Welch t.test will be used)  | T / F |
| Test.adjust.procedure | Choose the multiple test correction procedure | none / BH / ABH |
| Test.adjust.FDR | Choose the FDR for multiple test correction | {0,1} |
| Ratio | Choose the ratio that should be computed between conditions | fc / zscore |
| Volcano.threshold.pvalue | Significativity threshold for pvalue | {0,1} |
| Volcano.threshold.ratio | Significativity threshold for ratio | ℝ |
| Comparisons | List of paired conditions to compare | Exemple : 50fmol-25fmol;50fmol-10fmol |

The experimental design also have to be provided as an input. Here you can see an example of experimental design file : .<br/>

The module gives as outputs a TSV table summarizing input data, intensities after each step of processing and final results of statistical results. A report containg QC figures for each processing step and figures showing the results of differential analysis is also provided.
<br/>

- ***ROC :***<br/>

This module generates a report containing ROC curves. It takes as input a folder containing the tables generated by the DA module you want to compare.
