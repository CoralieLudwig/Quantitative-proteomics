# Quantitative-proteomics

This repository contains Rmarkdown modules dedicated to statistical analysis of quantitative proteomics data. <br/>
They are divided up into 2 projects : 
  - Instrumental quality control
  - Quantitative data analysis 
<br/>
The 1rst project contains modules that allow the controlling of LC-MS devices stability through a serie of acquisitions by analyzing the generated signal for a reference protein (ex : CytoC). <br/>
The 2nd project is dedicated to quantitative proteomic data analysis from QC to statistical differntial analysis.
